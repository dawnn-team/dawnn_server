# About
 This is the back-end code of the Dawnn project. Using Spring, Firebase and MongoDB, this server is able to recieve, store,
 and send images to clients (along with alerts) based on their reported geolocation.
 
# Inspiration 
 This project is inspired by the events in Belarus following the August 2020 election. It strives to support the democratic resistance movement by providing an easy-to-use application that can help peaceful protesters stay aware of potential threats.

This repository is for the server, and the client is available at [dawnn-team/dawnn_client](https://github.com/dawnn-team/dawnn_client). All components of this project are open source, and [contributions](#contributing) are encouraged. More information can be found at our [offical website](https://dawnn.org).

# For developers
  ### Getting started
   To get started, clone this repository. You need [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to resolve dependencies, and [version 15 of the JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk15-archive-downloads.html).
  ### Usage
   To use this project properly, you need a Firebase project. Information regarding this can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup). Without Firebase credentials on either the server side or client side, your local ecosystem cannot support notifications.
