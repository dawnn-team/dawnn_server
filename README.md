# About
 This is the back-end code of the Dawn project. Using Spring, Firebase and Cassandra, this is able to recieve, store,
 and send images to clients based on their reported geolocation.
 
# Background
 This project is inspired by the events in Belarus following the August 2020 election. It strives to support the democratic resistance movement by providing an easy-to-use application that can help peaceful protesters stay aware of potential threats.

This repository is for the server, and the client is available at https://github.com/dawnn-team/dawn_client. All components of this project are open source, and contributions are encouraged. More information can be found at dawnn.org (coming soon).
